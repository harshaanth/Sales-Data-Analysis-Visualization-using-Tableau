# Sales Data Analysis & Visualization using Tableau

## Project Overview
This project showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization using Tableau. The dataset used includes sales orders from 2012 to 2015, and I leveraged parameters, calculated fields, and visualizations to extract actionable insights and demonstrate business intelligence (BI) competencies. The project focuses on delivering clear, interactive visualizations that help to uncover trends, comparisons, and patterns in sales performance across different dimensions.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Parameter Control**: Users can toggle between different sales metrics such as revenue and quantity sold, providing flexibility in data analysis.
- **Time Series Analysis**: I have implemented a comparison between sales performance across different years, highlighting sales trends over time.
- **Sales Breakdown by Category**: Visualized sales performance at different levels, such as product categories, regions, and time.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Tableau Features**: Dynamic Parameters, Calculated Fields, Interactive Filters, and Drill-Downs.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed year-over-year sales performance, identifying key trends and outliers.
- **Business Intelligence**: Developed insights that can drive business decisions, such as identifying top-performing products and regions.

## Data Source
The dataset, `Orders2012-2015.xlsx`, contains historical sales data spanning 2012 to 2015. Key fields include:
- **Order Date**: The date when the order was placed.
- **Revenue**: The total revenue from each order.
- **Quantity Sold**: The number of units sold for each product.
- **Product Category**: The category of the product sold.
- **Region**: The geographical region where the sales occurred.
